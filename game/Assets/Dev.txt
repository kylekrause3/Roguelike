TODO:
     finish inventory system
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WnAOV7nHW0 timestamps in description
         make max list size 10 (can only hold 10 items)
         make sure inventory is accessible (drop shit and stuff)
     scripts for different items, powerups, etc
     finish thirdpersoncamera, with crosshair and such from youtube tutorial
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537B1kJp9YQ&t=235s
     add roll ability (maybe)
     shouldn't have multiple physics.check... in thirdpersonmovement.cs


BUGS:
     weird collision with rotated box
         this is not because of groundcheck/box collider, i think it's with the things labeled with BUG1 (gravity stuff) in thirdpersonmovement.cs
     you can now jump up big ass wall


OPTIONAL:
     You can add lighting to every individual ground item, kinda cute; gonna stick with universal color rn; prob do this with rarity of items in the future; see line 18 of item.cs for a start
