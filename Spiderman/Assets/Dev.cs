 * BUGS:
 *      groundcheck in player should be a sphere, i made it a square so that the cylinder worked, but now moving down diagnols is odd. 
 *      weird collision with rotated box
 *          this is not because of groundcheck/box collider, i think it's with the things labeled with BUG1 (gravity stuff) in thirdpersonmovement.cs
