/*TODO:

 *      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WnAOV7nHW0 timestamps in description
 *      make max list size 10 (can only hold 10 items)
 *      make sure inventory is accessible (drop shit and stuff)

 * 
 * 
 * BUGS:
 *      weird collision with rotated box
 *          this is not because of groundcheck/box collider, i think it's with the things labeled with BUG1 (gravity stuff) in thirdpersonmovement.cs
